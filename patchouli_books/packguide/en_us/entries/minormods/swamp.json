You can also put a variety of sweaters on them with Wool as well as dye their backpacks by right-clicking them with dye. All of these can be taken off with shears customizations. They can be bred with Tropical Fish or Tropical Fish Kelp Rolls. The offspring's appearance may be different than the parent's if they bred in a different biome!"
